            The service has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for,
            the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web

          <h3 className="text-secondary">Termination</h3>

          <p>
            I may terminate or suspend access to the Service immediately,
            without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever,
            including without limitation if you breach the Terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive

          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
            laws of Bosnia and Herzegovina, without regard to its conflict of
            law provisions.
          </p>

          <p>
            My failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
            be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these
            Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These
            Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding my
            Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might
            have between us regarding the Service.

          <h2 className="text-secondary">Changes</h2>

          <p>
            I reserve the right, at my sole discretion, to modify or replace
            these Terms at any time. If a revision is material I will try to
            provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking
            effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at my
            sole discretion.
          </p>

          <p>
            By continuing to access or use my Service after those revisions
            become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you
            do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.
