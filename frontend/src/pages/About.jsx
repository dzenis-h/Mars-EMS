            the instructions PDF file, which you can find in the bottom-right

            analyze the code for yourself, download the instruction with further
            explanations, or just watch the video to see what the app is all

                This is an EMS software - [Employee management system] that can
                help companies reduce their time spent on salaries, penalties,
                bonuses and a lot of other things regarding the accounting
                department, as well as many things regarding HR department
                [adding a new employee is only a few clicks away, and giving an
                end date is only a click away]. It contains many other features,
                like giving loans to employees, tracking their installments,
                making annual/ monthly reports, and so much more. It looks and
                feels great thanks to great structure and design, and even
                though it possesses a lot of features, the complexity is hidden
                from the end-user, so it always appears easy to use, no matter
